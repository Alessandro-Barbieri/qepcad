This is the QEPCADB project.  The actual software system is in
the qesource directory.  The public_html directory has some
documentation in it (same as the qepcad website), and the
regressiontests cirectory has some basic regression tests.  For
most people qesource is where to start.  Note that the license
information is in that directory and the distribution I provide
through the qepcad website is just that directory.
