This directory has a few basic regression tests.
Run this way:

qepcad < applicationTestSet | ./pullsf.pl | diff - applicationTestSet.out

If there is no output, then you've passed all the tests.
Unfortunately, this isn't quite perfect, because changes is QEPCADB
may cause different formulas or ordering of elements of formulas, so
that they are not textually identical even though equivalent.

###################################################################

This is a super simple set of regression tests.
I have problem sets, and I do a diff on the output
for the sets from old/new qepcad's or between ports
to different platforms.

* applicationTestSet

This is a set of problems that come from applications
or examples --- i.e. not random problems.  They should
test a wide variety of qepcad features, assumptions,
equational constraints, etc.  It all runs in a single
qepcad invocation.

* largeSetTestSet

This is a set of 1,000 QE problems of the form
(E y)[ p(x,y) = 0 ], where p is a random, dense polynomial 
of total degree 6.  They all run in a single qepcad
invocation.  This should give garbage collection and
memory leak issues a chance to surface.
Note:  some of the examples are large enough to need
a little extra memory on their own.  Try running as:
qepcad +N12000000

*****************************************************

* CAD2DlargeSetTestSet

This is the same set as "largeSetTestSet", but formatted
for cad2d.  Here too you'll need at least +N12000000.
If you post-process the output a bit, you can compare
qepcad to cad2d and they should give the same solutions.
However, cad2d is much faster on these examples! 
(Over 20x faster!)
