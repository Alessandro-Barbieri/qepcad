    <h1>Downloading and Installing <a href="../B/QEPCAD.html">QEPCAD</a><hr></h1>
    <p>
    <b>Download Instructions:</b>
      You must download the SACLIB library as well as QEPCAD.<br>
      Download <a href="qepcad-B.1.69.tar.gz"><code>QEPCAD B
	  version 1.69</code></a> 
    (see <a href="../B/LOG">LOG</a> of recent important changes )
    and
	<a href="saclib2.2.6.tar.gz"><code>saclib2.2.6</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Installation instructions:</b>
      Assuming that you've un-gzipped and un-tared qepcad and saclib,
      you need to:
    <ol>
      <li>Make SACLIB:
	<ol>
	  <li>Create an environment variable <code>saclib</code> that
	    points to the root of your saclib installation.<br>
	    <em>Example:</em> <b><code>setenv saclib
		${HOME}/saclib2.2.6</code></b>
	  <li>Set the environment variable CC to gcc.<br>
	    <em>Example:</em> <b><code>setenv CC gcc</code></b>
	  <li>Give the following commands:<br>
<b><code>cd $saclib/bin</code></b><br>
<b><code>./sconf</code></b><br>
<b><code>./mkproto</code></b><br>
<b><code>./mkmake</code></b><br>
<b><code>./mklib all</code></b><br>
	</ol>
	Assuming you haven't seen any error messages, saclib is now 
	successfully installed!
      <li>Make QEPCAD:
	<ol>
	  <li>Create an environment variable <code>qe</code> that
	    points to the root of your qepcad installation.<br>
	    <em>Example:</em> <b><code>setenv qe ${HOME}/qesource</code></b>
	  <li>Give the following commands:<br>
<b><code>cd $qe</code></b><br>
<b><code>gmake</code></b><br>
    </ol>
	Assuming you haven't seen any error messages, QEPCAD is now 
	successfully installed!  It might be nice to add
	<code>$qe/bin</code> to your path now, so that
	<code>qepcad</code> gets found without requiring a full path.
      <li>Make plotting program (Required only if the "display 2D CAD"
	command (<code>d-2d-cad</code>) will be used.)	
	Give the following commands:<br>
	<b><code>cd $qe/plot2d</code></b><br>
	<b><code>make</code></b><br>
	<b>NOTE:</b> This program relies on the OpenGL and Glut
	libraries.  If you don't have these libraries on your system,
	you'll need to install them!  
	<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/"><b>MesaGL</b></a> is
	free and will do the trick, just make sure to get the Glut
	library that's packaged along with the "demos".
	Whether you already have OpenGL/Glut or have to go out and get
	it, you may have to change some entries in plot2d/Makefile 
	to reflect the locations of these libraries and the X
	libraries on your system.  Email me if you don't know how to
	do this.<br>
      <li>
	Allow QEPCADB to use <a href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a>.
	Note the file <code>${qe}/default.qepcadrc</code>.  If
	you have the computer algebra system 
	<a href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a>
	installed, or if you install it in the future, you should edit
	this file to define the SINGULAR variable to be the full path
	up to, but not including, the Singular executable.  For example:
<pre>
#####################################################
# QEPCAD rc file.
# This file allows for some customization of QEPCADB.
# Right now, the ability to give a path to Singular,
# so that it gets used for some computer algebra
# computations is the only feature.
#####################################################
SINGULAR /usr/lib/Singular/3-0-0/ix86-Linux
</pre>
	With this in place, QEPCADB farms out some computations to
	Singular and, more importantly, can use Singular to compute
	Grobner Bases, which allows for a correct implementation of
	"equational constraints".
      </li>
      <li>Make CAD2D: (Optional)
	Give the following commands:<br>
<b><code>cd $qe/cad2d</code></b><br>
<b><code>gmake</code></b><br>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hints for troubleshooting the install:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li><b>Qepcad makefile trouble</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>The $qe/Makefile references "make", but it really needs
	    <em>gmake</em>.
	    If your system's "make" is not "gmake", install "gmake"
	    and change the calls to "make" in Qepcad's Makefile to
	    "gmake", and calkl "gmake" explicitly when you make Qepcad.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	Qepcad uses the "readline" library.  On Ubuntu, it was not
	installed by default for me ... like so many things.  I had to
	get it with <code>sudo apt-get install
	      libreadline5-dev</code>. (The current version is <code>libreadline6-dev</code>.)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
