    <h1><a href="../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - The Solution Formula Construction Phase<hr></h1>

    <p>
      When the stack construction phase is complete, QEPCAD has a CAD of 
      free-variable space with truth values attached to each cell.  This 
      represents the solution set of the (possibly quantified) input
      formula.  The last step is to represent this set as a formula (a
      <em>solution formula</em>), and 
      one of the big advantages of quantifier elimination by CAD is its
      ability to produce <em>simple</em> solution formula.  If you
      simply type <code>go</code> at the "<code>Before Solution &gt;</code>"
      prompt, QEPCAD will automatically construct a (hopefully) simple
      solution formula in the language of Tarski formulas.  However,
      more options are available with the <code>solution-extension</code>
      command.  To understand these options a bit better it's good to
      know a little bit about how solution formulas are constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      QEPCAD constructs solution formulas from the polynomials in the
      projection factor set defining the CAD of free-variable space.
      It is not always possible to construct a Tarski formula solely
      from these polynomials, in which case we must add polynomials to 
      the projection factor set.  
      A CAD-with-truth-values for which a Tarski solution formula can
      be built exclusively from the elements of the projection factor
      set is called <em>projection definable</em>.
      The command "<code>pdq</code>", which stands for projection
      definability query, allows the user to ask QEPCAD whether the
      CAD in the solution formula construction phase is projection
      definable. It is, however, always possible
      to construct an <a href="ETF.html"><em>Extended Tarski
	  Formula</em></a>
      (ETF) solution
      formula for a CAD-with-truth-values using just the polynomials
      in the projection factor set. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Basic Options</b>
      The <code>solution-extension</code> command takes a letter as an
      arguments that provides several different possibilities for
      solution formula construction.
    <div class="screen">
      <pre>
Enter an informal description  between '[' and ']':
[Produces a CAD that's not projection definable ]
Enter a variable list:
(x,y)
Enter the number of free variables:
1
Enter a prenex formula:
(Ey)[ x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0 /\ x + y &gt; 0 ].
=======================================================

solution-extension T
An equivalent quantifier-free formula:

x^2 - 3 &lt;= 0 /\ [ x &gt;= 0 \/ 2 x^2 - 3 &lt; 0 ]

Before Solution >
solution-extension E
An equivalent quantifier-free formula:

x^2 - 3 &lt;= 0 /\ x &gt; _root_1 2 x^2 - 3

      </pre>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><code><b>solution-extension T</b></code>
	This option produces a formula in the language of Tarski
	formulas, and in fact this exactly the routine that gets
	called if you simply type "<code>go</code>" at the
	"<code>Before Solution &gt;</code>" prompt, or
	"<code>finish</code>" at any point.  If the CAD is not
	projection definable, polynomials will be added to the
	projection factor set.
      </li>
      <li><code><b>solution-extension E</b></code>
	This option produces a formula in the language of
	<a href="ETF.html"><em>Extended Tarski Formulas</em></a>
	(ETFs).  Projection factors are never added to the projection
	factor set.
      </li>
      <li><code><b>solution-extension G</b></code>
	This option tries to produce a formula that gives insight into 
	the geometry of the solution set.  The method of doing so, and 
	the properties of the formulas that the method produces are
	described in Chapter 8 of 
	<a href="http://www.cs.usna.edu/~wcbrown/research/Thesis.html">my thesis</a>.
	Generally the formula will be an ETF rather than a Tarski
	formula.  The basic idea is that the set gets described in
	diskoint pieces.
      </li>
      <li><code><b>solution-extension F</b></code>
	This option produces a formula based purely ono the
	full-dimensional cells in free variable space.  This means
	that the truth values of lower dimensional cells are ignored.
      </li>
      <li><code><b>solution-extension I</b></code>
	This option enters the user into an "interactive" mode, which
	gives him more control over how solution formulas are
	constructed. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    The example to the left shows the various options in use on a
    simple example of an input that produces a CAD of 1-space that is
    not projection definable.  I left out the "<code>G</code>" option, 
    because it really isn't interesting for CAD's of 1-space - it
    needs at least 2-levels to do anything fun.  You see in this
    example that the polynomial <em>x</em> only appears in the formula 
    produced by "<code>soltution-extension T</code>".  That polynomial 
    is not in the projection factor set, and was actually added after
    the fact by QEPCAD in order to make it possible to construct a
    solution formula in the language of Tarski formulas.
