      <b>Starting QEPCAD</b>
      QEPCAD is a command-line program, so you launch it at the command
      prompt.  Assuming that the <em>qe</em> environment variable in
      your shell has been set to the root directory of your QEPCAD
      installation (<em>Example: </em> <code>setenv qe ${HOME}/qesource</code>)
      you run QEPCAD with the command "<b><code>$qe/bin/qepcad</code></b>".
    A somewhat unfortunate feature of the SACLIB library on which
    QEPCAD is based is that it initializes itself with a fixed-size
    piece of memory and simply fails if that gets filled up.  A larger 
    size piece of memory can be requested with the command-line
    argument <code><b>+N</b></code>.  The "+N" is followed by a number 
    - the number of cells in the garbage collected space.  the default 
    value is 2000000.  So to run QEPCAD with more memory you might
    give the command "<b><code>$qe/bin/qepcad +N8000000</code></b>".
    If you attempt a problem and get a failure message that
    QEPCAD/SACLIB ran out of memory, try upping the space with "+N".
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Basic Quantifier Elimination with QEPCAD</b>
      QEPCAD is an inherently iteractive program, and I will describe it 
      as such.  There are five basic steps in a QEPCAD session, though
      all but the first may be by-passed by the user simply by typing
      "<code>finish</code>". 
    <ol>
      <li><a href="EnterForm.html"><b>Entering the quantified input formula</b></a>
      <li><a href="Norm.html"><b>The normalization phase</b></a>
      <li><a href="Projection.html"><b>The projection phase</b></a>
      <li><a href="Lifting.html"><b>The stack constuction (or lifting) phase</b></a>
      <li><a href="Solution.html"><b>Solution formula construction</b></a>
    </ol>
    These five steps (or fewer if you choose to ignore them with a
    "<code>finish</code>" command) are enough to use QEPCAD to naively 
    solve quantifier-elimination problems.  Please follow the above
    links to the documentation on the individual steps to see how to
    use QEPCAD less naively and more effetively.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Beyond Basic Quantifier Elimination</b>
      Basic quantifier elimination takes a quantified Tarski formula
      as input and produces a quantifier-free Tarski formula as
      output.  QEPCAD does more than just this, however, and using its 
      other capabilities often allows you to solve problems more
      efficiently.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Simplification of Quantifier-free Formulas</b>.  One of
	QEPCAD's most important features is its ability to produce simple
	quantifier-free equivalent formulas (see the above link for 
	<a href="Solution.html">Solution formula construction</a>).  However,
	QEPCAD produces simple equivalent formulas even when the input 
	formula is already quantifier-free.  Thus, QEPCAD can be used
	to do formula simplification ... perhaps for formulas that
	generated by other quantifier elimination programs.  For very
	large formulas, repeated applications of QEPCAD	for
	simplification  of subformulas may succeed when applying
	QEPCAD directly to the entire formula fails.  I have some
	software for this, so please e-mail me if you're interested.
      <li><b>Beyond "there exists" and "for all"</b>.  Cylindrical
	Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) is essentially nothing more than a
	representation for <em>semi-algebraic sets</em>, which are
	precisely the sets that can be defined by Tarski formulas.
	Their importance for quantifier elimination lies in the fact
	that the projections implied by "there exists" and "for all"
	are trivial to carry out with the CAD representation.
	However, there are many other "quantifiers" that can be
	carried out just as easily with CADs, and QEPCAD offers
	several (see the above link for 
	<a href="EnterForm.html">Entering the quantified input formula</a>).
	Using these quantifiers in phrasing problems can drastically
	decrease the number of variables needed, which in turn can
	reduce computing time.
      <li><b>Plotting 2-dimensional CADs</b>.
	QEPCAD can generate "adjacency information" for 2-dimensional
	CADs, which allows it to generate topologically correct
	plots.  <a href="Plot.html"><b>More Information ...</b></a>
      <li><b>Beyond Tarski Formulas</b>.
	Both the input formula and the solution formula in the
	quantifier elimination problem are assumed to be Tarski
	formulas, meaning that each atomic formula is an equality or
	inequality in the free and bound variables.  QEPCAD is
	actually a quantifier elimination procedure for an extended
	language that includes "indexed root expressions". For
	example, we can use the input formula<br>
	<center><code>(E x)[ x = _root_3 x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c /\ x &gt; c ].</code></center>
	to express that there exist at least three distinct roots of
	the polynomial 
	<em>x<sup>3</sup> + a x<sup>2</sup> + b x + c</em>
	and that the third root (smallest to largest) is greater than
	<em>c</em>, the polynomials's trailing coefficient.  QEPCAD
	accepts input and produces output in this extended language.
    </ul>
