<p>
      Entering formulas in QEPCAD requires a little bit of thought.
      There are some decisions to made that can have a considerable
      impact on the time required for your problem.

=======================================================
Enter an informal description  between '[' and ']':
[ Finds x-coordinates of circle-line intersections ]
Enter a variable list:
(x,y)
Enter the number of free variables:
1
Enter a prenex formula:
(Ey)[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 /\ 3 x - 5 y + 1 = 0 ].

    <b>General Information</b> 
    QEPCAD fist asks for a problem description, which is really quite
    nice if you store a list of commands in a file that then gets sent 
    to QEPCAD by indirection.  Next you need to specify the variables
    that you use.  Ordering of variables is very important in
    quantifier elimination by CAD, and the variable list you give
    specifies not only the variables themselves, but also their
    ordering.  Free variables must appear before quantified variables,
    and the quantified variables must appear in the same order in 
    which they will appear in the prenex input formula (which is
    entered later).  Be forewarned that different variable
    orderings often produce wildly different running times!
    Finally, you must tell QEPCAD how many variables are free in the
    problem.  If you enter <em>k</em> for this value, then QEPCAD
    assumes that the first <em>k</em> variables in the given variable
    list are free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Formula</b>
      The formula you enter must be in prenex form.  Each
      quantified variable is introduced in parentheses by the
      quantifier followed by the variable name.  Quantifiers are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>E</code> = "there exists"
      <li><code>A</code> = "for all"
      <li><code>F</code> = "for infinitely many"
      <li><code>G</code> = "for all but finitely many"
      <li><code>C</code> = "for a connected subset"
      <li><code>X</code><em>k</em> = "for exactly <em>k</em> distinct values"
    </ul>

    Thus, "there exists an x such that for all y ..." would
    be written as <code>(E x)(A y)</code>.   The quantifier-free 
    part of the input must appear in brackets, and throughout
    the formula brackets are used for groupings of formulas, and 
    parentheses are used for algebraic expressions.
    The boolean operators are: 
    <code>/\ , \/ , ~ , ==&gt; , &lt;== , &lt;==&gt;</code>.
    The relational operators are: <code>= , /= , &lt; , &gt; , &lt;= , &gt;=</code>.
    Hopefully these are all self explanatory.  Qepcad doesn't
    understand precedence for boolean operators, so you must
    use brackets to remove ambiguity.  Atomic formulas can be
    equalities or inequalities of polynomials in the variables you've
    entered with rational coefficients, <em>or</em> they may
    <em>proper indexed root expressions</em> - please see
    <a href="ETF.html"><b>Extended Tarski Formulas</b></a> for more information.
    Finally, the input formula
    must be terminated by a period.
</p>

      <b>Phrasing Problems in the Best Way for QEPCAD</b>
      You can affect QEPCAD's performance quite drastically by how you 
      happen to translate a problem into an input formula.  Here are a 
      few things to keep in mind:
    <ol>
      <li>The fewer variables the better!  Use the extended language
	if you can as an alternative to introducing new variables.
      <li>Keep degrees low if possible!  For example, if a variable
	<em>x</em> always appears to an even power in a formula,
	replace <em>x</em> with <em>sqrt(x)</em> and add the
	restriction <em>x &gt;= 0</em> to the formula.
      <li>If you can use the quantifiers F = "for infintely many" or 
	G = "for all but finitely many" in place of E = "there exists"
	and A = "for all", definitely do it!!  QEPCAD can get rid of
	some algebraic number computations this way, and that can make 
	a huge difference!
      <li>Split formulas up into small independent pieces if possible!
      <li>If you can eliminate some variables on your own, do it!
	Remember, the fewer variables QEPCAD sees the better.
    </ol>
