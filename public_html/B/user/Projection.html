    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> This section of the documentation is out of date!</b><br>
      In the Projection Phase, QEPCAD computes a set of polynomials
      that implicitly defines the CAD that it will later explicitly
      construct in the <em>Stack Construction Phase</em>.  This set of 
      polynomials, the <em>projection factor set</em>, must satisfy
      some special properties in order to define a CAD.  So the goal
      of this phase is to construct as small a set as we can while
      ensuring that it defines a CAD and contains certain polynomials
      we'll need to solve the quantifier elimination problem.
      A <em>projection operator</em> is a function that's used to
      define a projection factor set, and several are available in
      QEPCAD.

      From the perspective of the average user, two
      projection operators are important:  Hong's projection and
      McCallum's projection.  McCallum's projection produces a smaller 
      projection factor set, but QEPCAD sometimes discovers during the 
      Stack Construction Phase that it cannot be sure of the validity
      of McCallum's projection and prints out an error message
      (actually a "possible error" message).
      Hong's projection is
      always valid, but produces a larger projection factor set.
      QEPCAD's default behaviour is to use a slightly improved version 
      of McCallum's projection
      operator.  
      [ Essentially it makes a half-hearted attempt to apply the
      Reduced McCallum projection. It's only half-hearted because it
      has a very weak system for trying to determine whether the
      system of coefficients for a projection factor is consistent. ]
      If QEPCAD later prints out an error message, it's up
      to the user to restart the computation and explicitly use
      Hong's projection operator instead of McCallum's.  (Note:
      McCallum's projection operator is always valid when projecting
      in 2 or 3 variables.)  In the example to the right, we show
      how to specify which projection operator should be used.
      Running this same example with the default (McCallum's
      projection used at every step) produces the error message
      "<code>Error! Delineating polynomial should be added over cell(2,2)!</code>"
      during the stack construction phase.  In this case it turns out
      that McCallum's projection is not invalid, it's just that QEPCAD 
      can't <em>prove</em> that it's valid.  Thus we must rerun the
      example with Hong's projection for all but the last two
      projection steps.  In general, if McCallum's projection produces 
      an error message for a problem involving variables 
      <code>(x1,x2,...,xk)</code> you should issue the command
      <code>proj-op (m,m,h,h,h,...,h)</code> where the list has
      <em>k-1</em> elements, all but the first two of which are '<code>h</code>'.
    </p>

      <b>The Advanced User</b><br>
      If you know some things about different projection operators you 
      can interact with QEPCAD to do better - specifically by removing 
      projection factors during the projection process.  I'll add some 
      info on that in the future!
