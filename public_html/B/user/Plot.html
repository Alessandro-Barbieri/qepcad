      Although currently not developed in a way that's easy to use or
      fast, QEPCAD is able to produce eps-file plots of CADs of
      2-dimensional space.  It seems like something people might like
      to have, so I offer it "as is".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Basic Command</b>  Once QEPCAD has constructed a CAD of
      2-space (usually you'd see the <em>solution</em> prompt, though 
      possibly still the <em>choice</em> prompt) you can produce an
      eps-file plot with the command
<p>
<code>p-2d-cad</code> <em>xmin</em> <em>xmax</em> <em>ymin</em> <em>ymax</em>
      <em>stride</em> <em>filename</em> <em>[z|Z|c|C]</em>
</p>
    The result is that a file named <em>filename</em> is created,
    which gives a plot in eps-format of the region 
    [<em>xmin</em>,<em>xmax</em>]x[<em>ymin</em>,<em>ymax</em>].
    The plot is produced by analyzing the topology of the CAD, then
    sweeping through from left to right and in increments of
    <em>stride</em> adding points to the model of the CAD.  This
    doesn't change the topology of the model, it just makes the
    picture look prettier.  In these plots where the view is
    [-2,2]x[-2,2], the <em>stride</em> varies from
    2.5 to 0.25 to 0.025:
    <p> <center>
      <img src="plot1.gif"/> <img src="plot2.gif"/> <img src="plot3.gif"/>
    </center></p>
    There are some optional paramters:
    <ul>
      <li>z turns off the display of dots at 0-dimensional cells, Z
	turns it on (which is the default)
      <li>c turns off color display, using grayscale instead, C turns
	it on (which is the default).
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What to Do With the eps-file</b>
      If you're not familiar with eps-files, you may not know what to
      do or how, so:
    <ul>
      <li>View the file using, for example,the <code>gv</code>
	utility.
      <li>Convert to a gif-file using the <code>pstogif</code>
	utility.
      <li>Convert to a pdf-file using the <code>epstopdf</code>utility.
      <li>Include in, for example, a latex document.
    </ul>
    While it may be pretty unappetizing to some people, you can open
    up the eps file in any text editor and make some changes if you
    don't like what I did.  For example, if you don't like the colors, 
    you can edit the block:
<pre>
%% This defines some default colors.
/DarkTrue { 0.2 0.4 1.0 setrgbcolor } def
/LightTrue { 0.2 1.0 1.0 setrgbcolor } def
/DarkFalse { 0.8667 0 0 setrgbcolor } def
/LightFalse { 0.8667 0.8667 0.8667 setrgbcolor } def
</pre>
    that appears near the top of the eps-file.  Just stick in your own 
    rgb values (I chose these randomly!).
