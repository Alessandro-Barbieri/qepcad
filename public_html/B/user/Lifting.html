    <h1><a href="../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - The Lifting Phase<hr></h1>

    <p>
      In the Lifting (or Stack Construction) Phase, which is indicated 
      in QEPCAD by the "<code>Before Choice &gt;</code>" prompt, 
      QEPCAD explicitly constructs a CAD of free
      variable space in which each cell is marked either <em>true</em> 
      or <em>false</em>.  The union of all <em>true</em> cells is
      exactly the set of points satisfying the input formula.
      This is done by explicitly constructing some or all of the CAD
      defined by the projection factor set produced by the
      <a href="Projection.html">projection phase</a> and propagating
      truth-values of cells in this CAD down to cells in free-variable 
      space according to the quantifiers appearing in the input formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lifting phase is almost always the most expensive phase of
      quantifer elimination by CAD both in terms of time and of space.
      First of all there is often many, many cells to be constructed.
      More often, however, the real bottleneck arises from
      computations with algebraic numbers.  Happily, there is a lot of 
      room for improvement in how QEPCAD deals with lifting, so there
      is hope that things may improve in future releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some nifty things you can do here, especially when
      there are exactly 2 free variables, because you can use
      topological information here.  I'll add more later!
