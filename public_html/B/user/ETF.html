    <p>
      Real quantifier elimination traditionally refers to eliminating
      quantified variables from <em>Tarski formulas</em>, which are
      boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities.
      The atomic formulas in a Tarski formula in the variables
      <em>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub></em> have the form
      <em>f(<em>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub></em>) s 
	g(<em>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub></em>)</em>, where
      <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> are polynomials with integer
      coefficients and <em>s</em> is one of the relational operators 
      &gt;,&lt;,=,/=,&gt;=,&lt;=.  Sets that are definable by Tarski
      formulas are called <em>semi-algebraic</em>
      (if <em>F(<em>x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub></em>)</em>
      is a Tarski formula it defines the subset of <em><b>R</b><sup>k</sup></em>
      consisting of all points <em><b>a</b></em> such that <em>F(<b>a</b>)</em>
      evaluates to true).  QEPCAD accepts a slightly larger language
      than simple Tarski formulas, a language we refer to as
      <em>Extended Tarski formulas</em>.  The extended language still
      defines exactly the semi-algebraic sets, but it allows some sets 
      to be described more easily than is possible with plain Tarski
      formulas, and this can translate into more efficient computation 
      for QEPCAD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The language of <em>Extended Tarski formulas</em> (ETFs) is defined in
      Chapter 7 of <a href="http://www.cs.usna.edu/~wcbrown/research/Thesis.html">my
	thesis</a>, and it is shown that we can perform quantifier
      elimination in this language using CADs - in fact it isn't really
      different than quantifier elimination for Tarski formulas using
      CADs.  That chapter also formally defines the class of
      <em>Restricted ETFs</em> and this language, which is still a
      superset of the language of Tarski formulas, is the language of
      input and output formulas in QEPCAD.  Here we only give an
      informal definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The language of Restricted ETFs extends the language of Tarski
      formulas by allowing atomic formulas of the form
      <em>x<sub>k</sub> s root<sub>j</sub>f(x<sub>1</sub>, ...,	x<sub>k</sub>)</em>, 
      where
      <em>f</em> is a polynomial with integer
      coefficients, <em>j</em> is a nonzero integer, and <em>s</em> is
      one of the relational operators &gt;,&lt;,=,/=,&gt;=,&lt;=.
      The truth of this atomic formula at the point 
      <em>(a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>)</em>, where <em>n &gt;= k</em>
      is false if the polynomial 
      <em>f(a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>k-1</sub>,x<sub>k</sub>)</em>
      has fewer than <em>k</em> distinct real roots, and is otherwise
      given by <em>a<sub>k</sub> s b</em>, where <em>b</em> is the 
      |<em>j</em>|<sup>th</sup> root of 
      <em>f(a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>k-1</sub>,x<sub>k</sub>)</em>
      ordered from smallest to largest if <em>j &gt; 0</em>  and
      largest to smallest otherwise.
      Remember that in a CAD construction problem there is an assumed
      order to the variables of 
      <em>x<sub>a</sub> &lt; x<sub>2</sub> &lt; ... &lt; x<sub>k</sub></em>.
      That order is a part of this definition!
