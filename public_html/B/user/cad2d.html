    <h1><a href="../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - The CAD2D Program<hr></h1>
    <p>    
    The CAD2D program is a minor modification of QEPCAD for quantifier-free
    formulas in 2 variables.  It is able to do some lifting steps
    completely with validated floating-point arithmetic, which can
    lead to much reduced overall time for 2-dimensional CAD
    computation.  Particularly, if you're interested in plotting a
    2-dimensional CAD, this is a better choice than QEPCAD.  It's a
    bit buggy, though.  Not in the "wrong answer" kind of way, but in
    the "might crash" kind of way.  Work in progress!

      <b>Using CAD2D</b>
      CAD2D works like QEPCAD, for the most part.  The main difference 
      is that once the formula is entered, the program automatically
      goes through the normalization, projection, and stack
      construction phases without any user interaction.

=======================================================
Enter an informal description  between '[' and ']':
[ An interesting CAD of R^2 to plot ]
Enter a variable list:
(x,y)
Enter the number of free variables:
2
Enter a prenex formula:
[ (x^2 + y^2)^4 - 7 x^6 y + 35 x^4 y^3 - 21 x^2 y^5 + 
  y^7 &lt;= 0 /\ 2 y &lt; x^2 + 1 ].

      <b>Implementation Information</b>
      CAD2D is in the <code>cad2d</code> directory.  It is essentially 
      just a few modified files from QEPCAD, linked together with the
      regular QEPCAD libraries to form a program that does a little
      bit of optimization of 2D CAD construction.  The code that does
      the numerical stuff is in <code>extensions/lift2D</code>.
