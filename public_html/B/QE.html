    <p>
      <b>An Informal Description</b><br>
      Informally, the quantifier elimination problem is this:  Given a boolean combination of
	equalities and inequalities of polynomials with integer coefficients in which some
	variables appear quantified, produce an equivalent formula in
	which no quantified variables appear (all variables are
	assumed to be real).
	For example, if the input formula is
      <center><em>there exists an <b>x</b> such that <b>a x<sup>2</sup> + b x + c = 0 and a /= 0</b></em></center>
	quantifier elimination should produce an equivalent formula like
      <center><em><b>a /= 0 and 4 a c - b<sup>2</sup> &lt;= 0</b></em></center>
      The quantified variable <em>x</em> has been eliminated.  
      In essence, the quantified input formula is a question, "When
      does there exist an <em>x</em> such that ...?", and the
      quantifier-free equivalent formula is an answer, "There exists
      sich an <em>x</em> when ...".
      Lots of 
      interesting problems in a wide variety of disciplines can be
      phrased as quantifier elimination problems.  Now, how many of
      the really interesting problems can be solved in a reasonable
      amount of time by todays software is another question ...

      <b>Quantifier Elimination Algorithms</b><br>
      Quantifier elimination by CAD is one algorithm for QE.  There
      are others, and in the future this section will describe some of 
      them and point you to other systems for QE.
