      This example is due to George E. Collins.  It asks for the
      "complex product" of a square and a segment in the complex
      plane.  The segment is [0,2]x{1} and the square is [2,4]x[-1,1].
      Probably the obvious way to phrase this as a QE problem is what
      you see in the first screen: x and y are set to the real and
      imaginary parts of the complex product of x1 + i and x2 + i y2,
      x1 + i being a point on the segment and x2 + i y2 being a point
      in the square.  However, with this formulation of the problem
      QEPCAD takes a prohibative amount of memory, and with enough
      memory the time would be prohibative.

      However, it's easy to see from the first equality that 
      y2 = x1 x2 - x, so we can substitute x1 x2 - x for y in the
      formula and eliminate one variable before we even start.  This 
      yields a second input formula, which is quite a bit better for
      QEPCAD than the first.  
      We can solve for x2 using the second equation, but doing so gives
      us the substitution x2 = (y + x)/(x1^2 + 1), which has a
      denominator.   We could still make the substitution and then
      clear denominators, but there is another more general solution
      using QEPCAD:  the remaining equation may be declared as an
      equational constraint 
      (<a href="../../user/EqConst.html"><b>documentation on equational constraints</b></a>).
      Equational constraints must be used with care, but if there is a 
      polynomial of the higest level that must be zero for the
      quantifier-free part of the input formula to be true, it may 
      be declared an equational contraint.  The second screen shows
      the QEPCAD session that realizes this input formulation.  In
      general, only one projection factor may be declared an
      equational constraint, although QEPCAD does not enforce this.

      In this form, QEPCAD solves the Edge-Square Product in 80
      seconds on my Sun Ultra 60.  There is, however, an even fast way 
      to arrive at the solution.  It can be proven that the answer to
      this problem must be a set that is the closure of an open set.
      QEPCAD is able to take a partial assignment of truth values to
      cells in a CAD of 2-space and deduce other truth values given
      that the set to be represeted is the closure of an open set.
      Here's what the input to QEPCAD would look like:

(E x1)(E x2)[
y = x1 (x1 x2 - x) + x2 /\
0 <= x1 /\ x1 <= 2 /\ 
2 <= x2 /\ x2 <= 4 /\ 
-1 <= x1 x2 - x /\ x1 x2 - x <= 1
