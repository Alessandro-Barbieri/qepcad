      <dt><b>Background</b></dt>
      <dd>      
	In "An effective decision method for semidefinite polynomials",
	Zeng Guangxing and Zeng Xiaoning,
	<em>Journal of Symbolic Computation</em> 37 (2004) pages 83-99,
	the authors give a special-purpose algorithm for deciding the
	semidefiniteness of multivariate polynomials and for providing
	witness points for polynomials that aren't semidefinite.  Here
	we consider how best to answer such questions with QEPCAD, and
	try QEPCAD out on one of their examples.

      <dt><b>Formulating the problem for QEPCAD</b></dt>
      <dd>
      The striaghtforward translation of "is p positive semidefinite"
      into quantifier elimination is 
      "&forall; x1, x2, ..., xn [ p(x1,...,xn) >= 0 ]".
      However, this is not a very efficient formulation for QEPCAD.
      If p fails to be positive semidefinite, there must be an open
      set of points on which p < 0.  So we can phrase our problem
      as the "not" of
<blockquote>
(F x1)(F x2)...(F xn)[ p(x1,...,xn) < 0 ]
</blockquote>
    where, recall, "F" means "there exist infinitely many".  Clearly
    if this formula is true p is not semi-definite.  After all, it
    would have been enough to find one point at which p is negative
    and we would have found infinitely many.  However, what if this
    formula returns false?  Is it possible that p could none-the-less
    not be positive semi-definite?  No, because if p is not positive
    semi-definite there is an open set of points in which p < 0, and
    this open set provides infinitely many values of x1 such that
    there are infinitely many values of x2 such that ... such that
    there are inifinitely many values of xn such that p(x1,...,xn) < 0.
    <p>
      Why is this formulation better?  Intuituvely, deciding "there
      exists infinitely many x" is easier because you can miss or ignore
      finitely many values of x and you'll still get the right answer.  In
      QEPCAD's case, it chooses to ignore the finitely many test
      values it has for x that not rational.  This way it doesn't have
      to do algebraic number computations and that's a HUGE win in
      terms of performance.

      <dt><b>The Example Problem</b></dt>
      <dd>
      Number 4 of Guangxing and Xiaoning "Examples of quaternary
      [i.e. 4-variate] polynomials" is:
    <blockquote>
      p = w^6 + 2 z^2 w^3 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 2 x^2 w + 2 x^2 z + 3 x^2 + w^2 + 2 z w + z^2 + 2 z + 2 w + 1
    </blockquote>
	CAD construction is very sensitive to variable ordering, and
	this example demonstrates that well.  As a general rule of
	thumb when producing a CAD for a single polynomial 
	try to order variables in
	<ol>
	  <li>Descending order by degree of variable, breaking ties with</li>
	  <li>Descending order by highest total-degree term in which
	    the variable appears, breaking ties with</li>
	  <li>Descending order by number of terms containing the
	    variable</li>
	</ol>
	When the input contains many polynomials hueristics for
	variable ordering become more complicated.  In this case, p is
	degree 6 in w and degree 4 in the rest, so our order starts as
	(w,...).  Amongst the remaining variables, z appears in a
	total degree 5 term, and the rest appear in terms of total
	degree at most 4, giving us (w,z,...).  Amongst x and y, x
	appears in more terms, so we end up with (w,z,x,y) as a
	variable ordering.
<p>
	The following QEPCAD session, run on a ??? MHz Pentium IV with ???
	MB RAM, shows that p is in fact positive semidefinite.  
	QEPCAD was run with the default size for Saclib's garbage
	collected space, which is 2MB, and required 0.15 seconds of CPU
	time to produce its result.
