    <h1><a href="../../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - A Triangles Problem</h1>
    
    <p>
    More information will eventually appear here!  What I want to say
    about things is this: The problem below is essentially a simple
    theorem about triangles.  The algebraic conditions on the side
    lengths a,b,c come from applying the law of cosines on a simple
    condition on two of the angles of this triangle, namely that the
    angle of the vertex opposite side c is greater than half the
      external 
      angle of
    the vertex opposite side b.  The input below gives that algebraic
    condition along with the assumption that a,b,c really are side
    lengths of some non-degenerate triangle.  We simplify the result,
    and we get a nice clean characterization in sides of what was
    originally specified in angles, namely that c > a.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem is a nice example of why declaring
      <em>assumptions</em> in QEPCAD B can be a very good thing.
      Since the assumptions are, naturally enough, assumed by the
      solution formula rather than appearing in the solution formula,
      the formula that returns is <em>very</em> easy to interpret.

=======================================================
Enter an informal description  between '[' and ']':
[ A Triangles Problem ]
Enter a variable list:
(c,b,a)
Enter the number of free variables:
3
Enter a prenex formula:
[ 
b^2 + a^2 - c^2 <= 0 \/ 
c (b^2 + a^2 - c^2)^2 < a b^2 (2 a c - (c^2 + a^2 - b^2)) 
].


=======================================================

Before Normalization >
assume [ a > 0 /\ b > 0 /\ c > 0 /\ a < b + c /\ b < a + c /\ c < a + b ]

Before Normalization >
finish

An equivalent quantifier-free formula:

a - c < 0
