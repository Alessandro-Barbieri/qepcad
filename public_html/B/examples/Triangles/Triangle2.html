    <h1><a href="../../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - A Triangles Problem</h1>

      <p>
	This example illustrates both quantifier-free formula
	simplification, and the <code>assume</code> command.  In it, a
	new theorem is both discovered and proved using nothing but
	formula simplification.
      </p>
    <p>
	If a formula that is already quantifier free is entered into QEPCAD B,
	the program produces a simple equivalent formula. As an interesting
	example of formula simplification in QEPCAD B, consider the following:
	Figure 1 shows a triangle <em>ABC</em> with what we might
	call the "external bisector" of vertex <em>B</em> with respect to <em>A</em>.
	<p>  
	  <center>
	  <img src="triangle.gif"><br>
	      <small>Figure 1: Triangle <em>ABC</em> with the external bisector of vertex <em>B</em>
		with respect to <em>A</em>.</small>
	  </center>
	</p>
	It is fairly clear from the diagram that this external bisector exists
	as drawn if and only if <em>theta > (pi - phi)/2</em>.
	Suppose we want this characterization of the existence of the
	"external bisector" in terms of the side
	lengths <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> rather than the
		    angles <em>theta</em> and <em>phi</em>.
	Straightforward application of 
	the common trigonometric identities produces the
	equivalent characterization that, if <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>
	and <em>c</em> are the side lengths of a non-degenerate
	triangle, this external bisector exists if and only if
	<p><em>
b<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> <= 0 \/ c (b<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> < a b<sup>2</sup> (2 a c - (c<sup>2</sup> +
	    a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>))</em>. <b>(1)</b>
	  </p>
	Of course <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> are the side
	lengths of a non-degenerate triangle if and only if 
	<p><em>
a > 0 /\ b > 0 /\ c > 0 /\ a < b + c /\ b < a + c /\ c < a + b</em>. <b>(2)</b>
	    </p>
The conjunction of <b>(1)</b> and <b>(2)</b> completely characterizes the triples of
real numbers <em>(a,b,c)</em> that are side-lengths of non-degenerate
triangles for which the above described external bisector exists.  
Entering this conjunction as
input to QEPCAD B produces the equivalent formula
<p>
<em>c > 0 /\ b > 0 /\ a - b + c > 0 /\ a - c < 0 /\ a + b - c >
	    0</em>,
</p>
	which is a little hard to interpret, because it's unclear which
	conditions simply specify a non-degenerate triangle, and which are
	specific to characterizing the existence of the external bisector.
	QEPCAD B allows us to declare "assumptions", which are conditions
	on the free variables that are "assumed" by the solution formula
	produced.  A true solution formula is actually the conjunction of the
	assumptions and the solution formula QEPCAD B produces.  Here is a
	QEPCAD B session for this simplification problem:

=======================================================
Enter an informal description  between '[' and ']':
[ Charaterizing triangles with external bisectors ]
Enter a variable list:
(c,b,a)
Enter the number of free variables:
3
Enter a prenex formula:
[ b^2 + a^2 - c^2 <= 0 \/ c (b^2 + a^2 - c^2)^2 < a b^2 (2 a c - (c^2 + a^2 - b^2)) ].
=======================================================

Before Normalization >
assume [ a > 0 /\ b > 0 /\ c > 0 /\ a < b + c /\ b < a + c /\ c < a + b ]

Before Normalization >
finish

An equivalent quantifier-free formula:

a - c < 0

====================================================
</pre>

In other words, given the assumption (i.e. the conditions that <em>a</em>,
<em>b</em> and <em>c</em> really form a triangle), the input formula is equivalent
to <em>a - c < 0</em>.  Simplification has "discovered" the theorem
that the external bisector described above exists if and only if side
<em>c</em> is longer than side <em>a</em>.
