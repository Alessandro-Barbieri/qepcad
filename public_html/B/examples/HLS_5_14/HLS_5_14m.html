    <h1><a href="../../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - Example: Hong, Liska, Steinberg 5.14</h1>
    <p>
    This example problem is formula 5.14 from Hong, Liska, Steinberg,
    "Testing Stability by Quantifier Elimination", Journal of Symbolic
    Computation, Vol. 24, No. 2, August 1997.  They report that QEPCAD
    was unable to prove 5.14 true (meaning the time or space resources 
    were prohibitive).  Here we show how we used the
    current version of QEPCAD and some tricks to prove formula 5.14
    true in 7.4 seconds (Sun Ultra60, 360MHz,256 MB).  It is important to note
    that all we did was break the problem up into smaller pieces that
    we could solve independently.  Moreover, this kind of splitting
    into subproblems could be performed automatically without too much 
    trouble.
    </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      The problem we consider here is:
    <pre>
F1 (formula 5.14 from the article) = 
(A a)(A b)(A c2)[ [0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 1] == &gt; A &lt;= 0 /\ C &lt;= 0 /\ [D &lt;= 0 \/ B &lt;= 0] ]
    </pre>
    where A, B, C, and D are polynomials in a,b, and c2.
    <pre>
A = c2^4 (a - b + 1) ( a - b - 1) (a - b)^2
B = 2 c2^4 b ( 3 a^2 b - 2 a^2 - 2 a b^2 + a + b^3 - b) 
    +  4 c2^3 a b ( a^2 - a + b^2 - b) 
    + 2 c2^2 a ( a^3 - 2 a^2b + 3 a b^2 - a - 2 b^2 + b )
C = c2^4 b^2 (b^2 - 1) + 4 c2^3 a b^2 (b - 1)
    + 2 c2^2 a b (3 a b - 2 a - 2 b + 1)
    + 4 c2 a^2 b (a - 1) + a^2 (a^2 - 1)
D = c2^2 ( 8 a^2 b^2 - 12 a^2 b + 5 a^2 - 8 a b^3 + 8 a b^2 
    + 2 a b - 4 a + 4 b^4 - 4 b^3  - 3 b^2 + 4 b  ) 
    + 2 c2 ( 4 a^3 b  - 2 a^3 - 4 a^2 b^2 - 2 a^2 b + a^2 
    + 4 a b^3 - 2 a b^2 + 2 a b - 2 b^3 + b^2  )  
    + 4 a^4 - 8 a^3 b - 4 a^3 + 8 a^2 b^2 + 8 a^2 b - 3 a^2 
    - 12 a b^2 + 2 a b + 4 a + 5 b^2 - 4 b
    </pre>
  </p>
    <p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    Formula F1 is equivalent to the NOT of
<pre>
F2 =
(E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt;= b &lt;= 1 /\ [A &gt; 0 \/ C &gt; 0 \/ [D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0] ]
</pre>
    It will be a bit easier to discuss <code>F2</code> instead of
    <code>F1</code>, which is the only reason I make the translation. 
    Now, if you enter this formula directly into QEPCAD on my
    UltraSPARC, the computation runs for 1,136 seconds before exiting
    with failure
    for a technical reason (the SACLIB library has a limited list of
    prime numbers available for modular routines, and this list of
    primes was exhausted during one modular algorithm call).  However,
    this is not the best way to input the problem to QEPCAD.  
    We're
    better off breaking it into several pieces.  Here's an equivalent
    formulation: 

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
      <tr align="center"><td>b = 0</td><td>or</td><td>b in the open
	  interval (0,1)</td><td>or</td><td>b = 1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td><pre>
F2'' =
(E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ b = 0 /\
[ A &gt; 0 \/ C &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0] 
] ]
</pre></td>
<td><code>\/</code></td>
<td><pre>
F2' =
(E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt; b &lt; 0 /\ 
[ A &gt; 0 \/ C &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0] 
] ]
</pre></td>
<td><code>\/</code></td>
	    <td><pre>
F2'' = 
(E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ b = 1 /\
[ A &gt; 0 \/ C &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0]
] ]
</pre></td></tr>

<tr align="center"><td colspan="5">Simplify by evaluating at b = 0 or
	    b = 1
	    (We denote "A evaluated at 0" by "A_0", for example)
</td></tr>

	    <tr><td><pre>
F2' =
(E a)(E c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 
[ A_0 &gt; 0 \/ C_0 &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D_0 &gt; 0 /\ B_0 &gt; 0] 
] ]
</pre></td>
<td><code>\/</code></td>
<td><pre>
F2'' =
(E a)(F b)(F c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt; b &lt; 0 /\ 
[ A &gt; 0 \/ C &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0] 
] ]
</pre></td>
<td><code>\/</code></td>
	    <td><pre>
F2''' = 
(E a)(E c2)[ 
0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\
[ A_1 &gt; 0 \/ C_1 &gt; 0 \/ 
  [ D_1 &gt; 0 /\ B_1 &gt; 0]
] ]
</pre></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><a href="In.1">Input file for F2'</a></td>
	<td></td>
	<td><a href="In.2">Input file for F2''</a></td>
	<td></td>
	<td><a href="In.3">Input file for F2'''</a></td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      Now, we've broken the input up into 3 pieces.  Fp' and Fp''' are
      clearly easier for qepcad because we've replaced a variable with a 
      constant.  It is perhaps less obvious that Formula Fp'' can be
      dealt with more efficiently by QEPCAD.  However, for any value of
      <code>a</code>, Fp'' becomes a formula in strict inequalities.
      This, there exists a <code>b</code> if and only if there exists
      <em>infinitely many</em> <code>b</code>'s, and for each
      <code>b</code> there exists a <code>c2</code> if and only if there exists
      <em>infinitely many</em> <code>c2</code>'s.  Thus, we may replace
      "<code>(E b)(E c2)</code>" with "<code>(F b)(F c2)</code>".
      QEPCAD is able to compute especially efficiently with this
      formulation.  In fact, on my machine QEPCAD takes 11.8 seconds to
      solve these three problems.  All three are equivalent to FALSE,
      so their or is equivalent to FALSE, meaning that the original
      formula is equivalent to TRUE.
    </p>    
    <p>
    <h2>A Better Solution</h2>
    We can even improve on the above slightly by (quite logically)
    breaking our formulas up still further!  Formula F2' and F2''' can 
    be solved so quickly by QEPCAD that there's no particular point in 
    breaking them up.  On the other hand, F2'' takes a while, and we
    can break it up trivially into three pieces using the distributive rule:
    <pre>
aF2'' = (E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt; b &lt; 0 /\ A &gt; 0 ]

bF2'' = (E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt; b &lt; 0 /\ C &gt; 0 ]

cF2'' = (E a)(E b)(E c2)[ 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 /\ 0 &lt; b &lt; 0 /\ D &gt; 0 /\ B &gt; 0 ] 
    </pre>
    Thus, the solution to our original problem is the NOT of
    <p><b>
      <a href="In.1">Fp'</a> <span class="caption">OR</span> <a href="In.2.1">aFp''</a>
      <span class="caption">OR</span> <a href="In.2.2">bFp''</a> <span class="caption">OR</span> <a href="In.2.3">cFp''</a>
      <span class="caption">OR</span> <a href="In.3">Fp'''</a>
    </b></p>
    On my machine QEPCAD takes 7.4 seconds to do all 5 of these.
