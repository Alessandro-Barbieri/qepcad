    <h1>QEPCAD Example: Collins 2001</h1>
    This example came to me from George Collins.  It arose as part of
    some investigations of his into the Descartes Method of real root
    isolation.
<p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<pre>
(E a)(E b)[0 &lt; a /\ a &lt; 1 /\ 1 &lt; b /\ b &lt; 2 /\ d &gt; 0 /\ A &gt; 0 /\ B &lt; 0]</pre>
where
<pre>
A = 4 a b d^2 - 5 b d^2 - 5 a d^2 + 6 d^2 + 4 a b c^2 - 5 b c^2
    - 5 a c^2 + 6 c^2 - 10 a b c + 12 b c + 12 a c - 14 c + 6 a b - 7 b
    - 7 a + 8

B = 6 a b d^2 - 9 b d^2 - 9 a d^2 + 13 d^2 + 6 a b c^2 - 9 b c^2
    - 9 a c^2 + 13 c^2 - 18 a b c + 26 b c + 26 a c - 36 c + 13 a b 
    - 18 b - 18 a + 24</pre>
    <a href="C2001.pdf">Here's a pdf-file picture</a> of the solution
    space for the problem.  You're seeing [0.25,2.75] x [-1.5,1.5],
    and the blue and green portion is the actually solution set.
    <p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
      Using <a href="BasicInput.qe">this basic input file</a>, QEPCAD
      takes a fairly long time to run.  The only special command given 
      in this file is "prop-eqn-const", which means "propogate
      equational constraints".  There are, of course, no equational
      constraints here, so the only effect of this command is that
      QEPCAD uses the McCallum projection operator.  QEPCAD quickly
      runs out of memory for this problem with its default amount of
      garbage collected space.  So to run QEPCAD on this example it
      should be invoked with the "+N" option, eg:
<pre>
qepcad +N8000000
</pre>
    Running qepcad without any +N value is equivalent to 
    <code>qepcad +N2000000</code>.  It takes QEPCAD 128 seconds to
    come up with the solution:
<pre>d &gt; 0 /\ [ 2 d^2 + 2 c^2 - 5 c + 3 &lt; 0 \/ 11 d^4 + 22 c^2 d^2 - 54 c d^2 + 31 d^2 + 11 c^4 - 54 c^3 + 99 c^2 - 80 c + 24 &lt; 0 ]</pre>
    Can we do better? [<b>Note:</b> Because QEPCAD does not implement
    the lifting method for the McCallum Projection, and because two
    3-level projection factors do vanish identically at a point,
    there is the possiblity that our answer is invalid.  That's not
    the case here, however, as the below shows. ]
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using the option <code>res-alg S</code> tells QEPCAD to
	compute its resultants and discrimintants using the
	subresultant PRS method instead of the modular method.  This
	tends to work better for sparse polynomials, and in this case
	the time for the projection phase is more than halved
	... which saves about 0.3 seconds.
	<p>
      <li>
	Another improvement is to use the Improved McCallum Projection
	defined in [Brown, accepted for publication, JSC 2001].  The
	McCallum projection includes all discriminants, pairwise
	resultants and coefficients of projection factors in its
	projection.  The Improved McCallum Projection includes only the
	leading coefficients of projection factors.  As long as the
	polynomial being projected does not vanish identically, this is
	guaranteed to be valid.  In the first projection (eliminating
	b), we only need worry about whether A or B vanish identically 
	anywhere.  Since both polynomials are linear, they may only
	vanish identically over the resultant of their coefficients.
	So, we add Res_a(ldcoeff_b(A),trcoeff_b(A)) to the projection
	factor set, and Res_a(ldcoeff_b(B),trcoeff_b(B)) to the
	projection factor set.  This ensures that we will will lift
	over regions where A and B are either identically zero or not
	identically zero, and never regions where both may hold.  A
	simple calculation shows that none of the 3-level polynomials
	vanish identically over the region d &gt; 0.  So,
	<a href="BetterInput1.qe">here is a better input file</a> for
	solving the same problem.  This takes 42.6 seconds on my
	machine.  It's worth noting that in truth no new polynomials
	are "added" to the projection factor set, since the two
	resultants from the above appear as projection factors anyway
	from other parts of the projection.
	<p>
      <li>Assigning a truth value to a specific cell in in the CAD of
	free variable space (i.e. the d-c plane here) means solving
	the decision problem obtained by substituting the sample-point 
	value into the original formula.  Thus, assigning a truth
	value to a specific cell in in the CAD of free-variable space
	is an instance of the decision problem for a set of strict
	polynomial inequalities ... and McCallum 1993 tells us that we 
	only need to look at full dimensional cells to answer that
	question.   Therefore ... we don't need to worry about whether 
	or not A and B vanish identically anywhere, becuase they
	vanish identically over some subset of the zero-set of their
	leading coefficients, and now we know that there is no need to 
	lift over their leading coefficients.  It's a little difficult 
	to actually take advantage of this with QEPCAD in its current
	configuration.
	<p>
      <li>Finally, we note that the set defined by the quantifier-free 
	part of the input formula is bounded in both a and b.  As
	described in [Brown, accepted for publication, JSC 2001], this 
	means that even the leading coefficients need not be included
	when projecting to eliminate a and b.  The same requirement,
	however, that the polynoimials we project not vanish
	identically anywhere remains.  
	The only place that this might happen is above the zeros of
	R = Res_a(ldcoeff_b(B),trcoeff_b(B)).
	Thus, we divy our problem into
	two pieces:
	<p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><b>R /= 0</b>
	  <dd>In <a href="BetterInput2a.qe">this input file</a> we
	    restrict to R not equal to zero, and thus we do not need
	    to include any leading coefficients. This takes about 2.3
	    seconds.
	  <dt><b>R = 0</b>
	  <dd>In <a href="BetterInput2b.qe">this input file</a> we
	    ristrict to R equal to zero, and we inlude the leading
	    coefficient of B.  However, now R is an equational
	    constraint, and we take advantage of this in the
	    projection and lifting!   This takes about 0.3 seconds.
	</dl>
	Finally, we take the disjunction of the two results (<a
	  href="BetterInput2c.qe">in this input file</a>) and simplify 
	to get the same final answer as before. This takes about 0.1
	seconds. Thus, the total time to solve the problem drops to
	about 2.7 seconds.  I've played a little loosely here, because 
	I haven't checked whether any 3-level polynomials vanish
	identically.  In fact this input is perfectly valid, because
	only one 3-level projection factor vanishes identically
	<p>
<li>
	Let's consider putting this all together into an "automatic"
	process, i.e. what the computer would do if it followed the
	approach advocated in [Brown, to appear JSC].  The tree below
	shows all the computations, and here the question of whether
	or not a polynomial vanishes identically is simply solved by
	creating a new qepcad problem which looks for solutions to the 
	system of coefficients .
	<pre>

                                          vanish identically?

           R = Res_a(ldcoeff(B),trcoeff(B))
	</pre>
	The total amount of time required to solve this problem, given 
	as the sums of the times for all subproblems, is 3 seconds,
	and the final solution formula is exactly what we got in 128
	seconds using the basic input file.
	<p>
	  <b>Note 1:</b> When lifting over c = 3/2 in <a
	    href="BetterInput3a.qe">Sol S2</a>, we have to "add" the
	  point (3/2,+sqrt(1/12)) to the CAD according to [Brown, to
	  appear JSC]. However, this point is an individual cell
	  anyway, due to other projection factors, so we don't need
	  to do anything.
	<p>
	  <b>Note 2:</b> According to the McCallum projection, we have
	  to add a "delineating polynomial" when lifting over points
	  where the projection factor P_3,6 vanishes identically.
	  However, as noted in [Brown, to appear JSC], this is not
	  necessary, since the only derivation of the polynomial P_3,6 
	  is as a leading coefficient - thus, it only needs to be
	  sign-invariant (as opposed to order invariant) for lifting
	  into 4-space to be valid.
    </ol>
	<p>
    <b>Note:</b> Since a and b appear linearly in this problem, I
      tried using <a
	href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~redlog/">REDLOG</a> to
      solve it. <a href="REDLOG.screen">Here is the session</a> and <a 
	href="REDLOG.out">here is the output formula</a>.  Redlog
      solves the problem in 54 seconds, and returns a formula which
      when stored results in a 233Kb file.
