    <h1><a href="QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> -
      <small>What is QEPCAD?</small><hr></h1>
    <p>
      <b>The Program</b><br>
      QEPCAD is an implementation of quantifier elimination by
      partial cylindrical algebraic decomposition due orginally to
      Hoon Hong, and subsequently added on to by many others.  It is 
      an interactive command-line program written in C/C++, and based on 
      the SACLIB library. 
      Presented here is 
QEPCAD B version 1.x,
      the "B"
      designating a substantial departure from the original QEPCAD
      and distinguishing it from any development of the original
      that may proceed in a different direction.
    QEPCAD and the SACLIB library are the result of a program of
    research by George Collins and his PhD students that has
    spanned several decades ... and continues still!

    <p>
      I extended and improved QEPCAD for several years.
      Improvements that didn't involve changes to the way the program
      interacted with the user I'd just go ahead and make.  However,
      changes that affected the interaction of QEPCAD and the user, or
      changes that added new features were "tacked on" to the program,
      requiring the user to know about extra commands.  Moreover, there
      was no cannonical source for QEPCAD distribution or documentation, 
      and no internet accessible source at all.
    This branch of QEPCAD, QEPCAD "B", was introduced to address
    those problems - to make QEPCAD easily accessable through the
    internet, to provide good documentation, and to incorporate many
    improvements and extensions in a way that makes them most
    accessible to the user.
