qepcad 1.69 Fri, 16 Mar 2012
Added -h and -noecho command-line options.  Use of # as a 
comment character.  Note that at present, some Qepcad 
sub-commands, like those for plotting, probably don't allow
for the comment character.  This will require some more 
investigation than I have time for right now.
Cleaned up code for processing command line arguments in 
Qepcad. Right now it should report errors on unkown options, 
and it doesn't process options processed by saclib.
Updated cad2d's MAIN.c so that it's in line with some recent 
improvements to Qepcad.

A bug in introduced in version 3.82 of GNU make causes the 
call to make in $qe/source to fail.  I filed a bug report 
(bug report #33274) but, since that may never be fixed or at 
any rate folks will be using 3.82 for a while, I modified 
$qe/source/Makefile to work around the problem.  The makefile 
is harder to mantain now, but at least it works.

Cleaned and reorganized code dealing with intialization and 
cleanup.  As part of that, Qepcad now redefines Saclib's FAIL 
function so that child Singular processes are cleaned up 
before exiting.

Fixed bug that caused segfault when plotting partial CADs. 
Fixed bug-esque problem in plot2d that maxed out the CPU 
purposely ... GLUT's idle callback was happening about 
1,000,000 times a second!

Fixed some issues with rendering.  In particular, ADJ2D_plot 
no longer relies on FIFOs, it is now simple pipes.

Modified code to compile properly for 64-bit architectures.
This relies on having at least saclib2.2.3 and tests the
 __WORDSIZE macro to see whether its value is 32 or 64.
