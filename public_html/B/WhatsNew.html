    <h1><a href="QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - What's New?<hr></h1>
    <p>
      <b>New Features and Improvements</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Version 1.54 adds portability to 64-bit systems.  Right now, I
	can only verify that it compiles and runs properly on 64-bit
	Ubuntu ... hopefully it's also OK on other 64-bit linux distros.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="../SLFQ/Home.html">SLFQ</a>
      <small>(Simplifying Large Quantifier-free Formulas with QEPCAD B)</small>,
      a small program that simplifies large quantifier-free formulas
      by making repeated calls to QEPCAD B to simplify subformulas.
      In its current configuration, SLFQ requires at least QEPCAD B
      version 1.54. 
      </li>
      <li>QEPCAD now accepts input and (if desired) produces output in 
	an extended language that allows references to indexed roots
	of polynomials. <a href="user/ETF.html"><b>More Information ...</b></a>
      <li>QEPCAD allows an extended family of quantifiers including
	"for infinitely many", "for all but finitely many", "for
	precisely a connected subset", and "for exactly <em>k</em>".
	QEPCAD is able to solve problems phrased with these
	quantifiers <em>much</em> more quickly than if they were
	translated into Tarski formulas!  Especially if "for
	infinitely many" or "for all but finitely many" are used.
	<a href="user/EnterForm.html"><b>More Information ...</b></a>	
      <li>QEPCAD produces eps-file plots of 2-dimensional CADs.
      <li>A modified version of QEPCAD that's optimized for 2D CAD
	construction is included.  It's called CAD2D.
	<a href="user/cad2d.html"><b>More Information ...</b></a>
      <li>The McCallum Projection is now the default projection for
	QEPCAD, and the program deals correctly with the possibility
	of the projection's failure.  
	<a href="user/Projection.html"><b>More Information ...</b></a>
      <li>QEPCAD can always produce solution formulas.  The original
	was sometimes only able to produce separate necessary and
	sufficient conditions.
      <li>General fixing of bugs and speeding up of bottlenecks.
    </ul>
