                        Sample Points

Sample points are either in primitive or extended representation.
A sample point in primitive representation is a list (M,I,b)
of length 3.  M is the integral minimal polynomial of an algebraic
number alpha and I is an isolating interval for alpha as a root
of M.  b is a list (b_1,...,b_k), k >= 1, where the b_i are the
coordinates of the sample point, each integrally represented as
elements of Q(alpha).  If all coordinates of b are rational
numbers then M and I are arbitrary but are usually taken to be
x and [0] respectively.

Elements of an algebraic number field Q(alpha) are, in various
contexts, in either of two representations.  Let beta be an element
of Q(alpha), n the degree of alpha.  If beta /= 0, the rational
representation of beta is the unique rational polynomial (element of
Q[x], B, of degree less than n such that B(alpha) = beta.  The
integral representation of beta is the unique pair (b,B^) such that
b is a rational number, B^ is a positive primitive integral
polynomial, and B = b * B^.  If beta = 0 then its representation in
either case is just the single-precision integer 0.

A sample point in extended representation is a list (A,J,M,I,b) of
length 5.  M, I, and b are the same as in primitive representation
above.  A and J define an additional algebraic number b_{k+1}
as the unique root of the algebraic polynomial A in the isolating
interval J, A being a squarefree polynomial with coefficients in
Q(alpha).  The program CONVERT converts a sample point from extended
to primitive representation by computing a primitive element gamma
for Q(alpha,beta).
