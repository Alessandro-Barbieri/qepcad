    <h1>RCAD</h1>
<h2>RCell : a new data structure, a refined CAD</h2>
<p>
      An RCAD is a list 
      (LEVEL, CHILD, ASSIGNED, TRUTH, SAMPLE, INDX, SIGNPF, HOWTV, DEGSUB,
      MULSUB, INCELL), with the following meanings:

<p>
 <OL>
 <LI>LEVEL - the level of the cell.</LI>
 <LI>CHILD - a list of RCell data structures, the children.</LI>
 <LI>ASSIGNED - Assignment flag (for parallel execution only).</LI>
 <LI>TRUTH - the truth value of the cell: TRUE, FALSE, or UNDET.</LI>
 <LI>SAMPLE - a sample point data structure.</LI>
 <LI>INDX - the index of the cell as a list.</LI>
 <LI>SIGNPF - a list (S_1,...,S_k), where k is the LEVEL of the cell.
     S_i is a list (s_1,...,s_n) where n is the number of k-i+1 level
     projection factors, and s_j is the sign of ... well here I change
     things.  The n projection factors at some level m are
     (P_m,i_1, P_m,i_2, ... , P_m,i_n), where i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_n.
     So s_j is the sign of P_i,i_{k-i+1} in the cell.

</LI>
 <LI>HOWTV - how the truth value was assigned, the possibilities
     are BYTEV = trial evaluation, BYPRP = propogation, 
     BYEQC = equational constraint, and NOTDET = not determined.</LI>
 <LI>DEGSUB - List of degrees of substituted projection factors.</LI>
 <LI>MULSUB - List of multiplicities of substituted projection factors.</LI>
 <LI>INCELL - the cell in the qepcad CAD which contains this RCELL.</LI>
 <LI>OSPFLAG - a flag that equals 1 if this cell's sample point was a
               sample point from the original CAD.</LI>
 </OL>
