solution-extension x
 
Use an alternative solution formula construction method.  The
parameter x is allowed to be T,E,G, or I.  If x is T, then a
formula in the usual language of Tarski formulas is produced.
If x is E, a formula in the language of Extended Tarski formulas
is produced.  If x is G, then a geometry-based formul is
produced. Finally, if x is I, and "interactive mode" is entered
and the user is queried to determine how the formula is to be
constructed and displayed.

Display 2D CAD
-------------------------------------

1. Calling the display program
------------------------------
d-2d-cad displays 2-dimensional CAD's.  If the CAD has larger dimension, 
the induced CAD of 2-space is displayed.  d-2d-cad can be called either 
with the argument "D", which causes the program to choose viewing
parameters for you, or with the argument E and a list of specific values 
for those parameters.  The parameters are:

4 floating-point values: x1 x2 y1 y2, which represent the portion of
the plane that's included in the plot --- namely [x1,x2] X [y1,y2].

2 positive integer values: Sx Sy which give the dimensions (in pixels)
of the plot window --- namely Sx X Sy.

1 floating-point value: e, which gives the distance between successive
x-values for which points in section cells are determined.

Ex:

d-2d-cad D

  - or -

d-2d-cad E -1.75 2.25 -2.0 1.0 400 300 0.125


2. Interactive Commands
------------------------------
Once the d-2d-cad command has been given, a plot window appears with
an initial plot based either on the explicitly given  parameter values
or default parameter values computed by the program.  After the display 
window appears, the current viewing window coordinates are given and 
the user is prompted for a command.  The possible commands are printed
out at the prompt.  They are the single characters:

n -- which stands for "number of points".  The plotting program 
     accurately places each single-point cell (i.e. section over a
     section) in the plotting window.  Curves (sections over sectors)
     connecting single-point cells are approximated by computing points
     on the curve, and connecting them by line segments.  $n$ equally
     spaced x-values are chosen, and points on curves are computed for
     each of these x-values.  Increasing the "number of points" increases
     the accuracy with which these curves are approximated.  Note that
     the plot is topologically correct regardless of the "number of 
     points".  After typing 'n' and pressing return, the plotting program
     will prompt you for a number.

c -- which stands for "viewing window coordinates".  The plot widow
     shows a picture of some rectangle in 2-space that is referred to as
     the "viewing window".  If this command is given, the program prompts
     you to enter 4 floating-point numbers, separated only by whitespace.
     These provide the coordinates of the new viewing window: 
       xmin xmax ymin ymax, where xmin < xmax and ymin < ymax

p -- which stands for "print postscript".  This command allows you to
     make an eps file of the currect plot.  You will be prompted for a
     file name, and for "accuracies" x-values and for y-values.  Since
     postscript devices are typically capable of a much higher resolution
     than computer monitors, it may be desirable to place points quite
     accurately in the plot.  When you are promoted for an accuracy, the
     current accuracy will be displayed.  If you request less accuracy it
     is simply ignored.  More accuracy requires recomputation.  

w -- which stands for "new plot window".  If this command is given, a new
     plot window is created, which is exactly like the old plot window.
     However, any subsequent interactive commands only affect the new plot
     window.  The old plot window remains the same.

q -- which stands for quit.  This command exits the plotting program and
     returns to qepcad's interactive interface.
