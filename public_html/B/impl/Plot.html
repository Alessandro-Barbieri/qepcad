    <h1>Plot Language Documentation</h1>
    The rend package is designed to produce a description of a CAD
    plot in a small language defined as follows:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Initialization</b>
      <dd>
	<dl>
	  <dt><code>d1 d2</code>
	  <dd>
	    Two int's separated by a space and followed by a
	    newline. This should indicate the size in pixels of 
	    the plot window.  d1 is pixel size for width, d2 is pixel
	    size for height.
	</dl>
	<p>
      <dt><b>Command Loop</b>
      <dd>What follows are the literal characters that are sent to
	indicate the type of object to be described, along with
	descriptions of the info following the character code.
	<dl>
	  <dt><code>L</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 2-level section over a 1-level sector.  A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value. Then and int n giving the number of points in the
	    polyline to follow.  Then n pairs of int's giving the
	    xy-coordinates of the points comprising the polyline.
	  <dt><code>P</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 2-level sector over a 1-level sector. A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value. Then and int n giving the number of points in the
	    polygon to follow.  Then n pairs of int's giving the
	    xy-coordinates of the points comprising the polygon.
	    Vertices may or may not appear twice in this list, but
	    they will be ordered.
	  <dt><code>R</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 2-level sector over a 1-level section. A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value. Then three int's x, y1, y2.  The segment with
	    endpoints (x,y1) and (x,y2) should be produced.
	  <dt><code>V</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 1-level section. A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value. Then one int x, y1, y2.  The segment with
	    endpoints (x,-infinty) and (x,+infinity) should be produced.
	  <dt><code>C</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 1-level sector. A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value. Then two int's x1 and x2.  The rectangle 
	    (x1,x2)x(-infinty,+infinity)
	    should be produced.
	  <dt><code>S</code>
	  <dd>Means draw a 2-level section over a 1-level section
	    (i.e. a single point). A
	    single character (T/F/U) follows that indicates truth
	    value.  Then two int's x and y.  A point should be
	    produced at coord's (x,y).
	  <dt><code>F</code>
	  <dd>Refresh.
	  <dt><code>E</code>
	  <dd>Means the graphics data is at an end.
	</dl>
    </dl>	
    This information is produced by the exceedingly ugly code in the
    file WRITE_PLOT.cc.
