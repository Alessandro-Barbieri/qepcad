    <h1>Plotting Instructions</h1>
    George,  This should give you an idea of how plotting works with the
    new "interactive" postscript file option.  The following shows an
    example session in which all sections of 2-level projection
    factors are printed in pink (I'm not saying this is tastefull!)
    over a red grid that is centered at the origin, and which has a
    mesh of 1.5 units in <em>x</em> and 0.25 units in <em>y</em>.
    Superimposed on top of this is a coordinate axis, centered at the
    origin, in sienna.  User input appears in bold.

      <dl>
      <dt><b>Precision</b>
      <dd>This controls how precisely sample point coordinates are
	approximated.  If you type in "-12" for the x-precision, then
	x-coordinates will be computed to within 2^(-12).  If you
	enter a precision less than the "Current" value, the current
	value is simply used.
<p>
      <dt><b>Colors</b>
      <dd>The colors available to you are given in <a
	  href="COLORS.txt">COLORS.txt</a> (ignore the numbers and
	just look at the names).  If you type a name not in 
	this file, an error message is simply returned.  This is one
	of the few example of typo-tolerence in this program! :-)
<p>
      <dt><b>Complex Plots</b>
      <dd>The basic idea here is that each element you plot is layered 
	upon the others, so you can have a grid be superimposed on the 
	other elements by plotting it last, for example.  This gives
	you a lot of control.
