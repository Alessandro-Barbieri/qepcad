    <h2>General</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Indices</b> of cells are: 1 for the first actual cell in the
	stack, AD2D_ErrI for an undefined (e.g. uninitialized) index, 
	AD2D_Infy for the virtual cell at positive infinity, and
	AD2D_N_In for the virutal cell at negative infinity.  Note
	that AD2D_ErrI, AD2D_Infy, and AD2D_N_In are defined in
	<a href="../../extensions/adj2d/adj2D.h">adj2D.h</a>, and that the virtual
	cells at +/- infinity are considered to be sections.
<p>
      <li><b>Truth values</b> are TRUE, FALSE, and UNDET.  These are
	#define's appearing in <a
	  href="../../source/qepcad.h">qepcad.h</a>. 
	<p>
      <li><b>Graphical CAD Language</b>
	<a href="Plot.html">Detailed Info</a>.
    </ol>
<p>
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Rend_Cell
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Cell.h">Rend_Cell.h</a> and <a
	  href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Cell.cc">Rend_Cell.cc</a>.
	  An object of type Rend_Cell represents a cell in a CAD.  In
	  keeping with QEPCAD's recursive view of CAD's the entire CAD 
	  is represented by the base-cell of that CAD, in this case
	  the Rend_Cell object corresponding to the 0-level cell.
	<p>
      <dt>Rend_Sample
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Sample.h">Rend_Sample.h</a> and <a
	  href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Sample.cc">Rend_Sample.cc</a>.  An object of type 
	Rend_Sample represents a sample point for a cell.  There are
	several subtypes of Rend_Sample
	<ul>
	  <li>Rend_Sample_1DS: a sample point for a 1-level section
	    cell
	  <li>Rend_Sample_1DO: a sample point for a 1-level sector
	    cell
	  <li>Rend_Sample_2DS: a sample point for a 2-level section
	    cell over a 1-level section
	  <li>Rend_Sample_2DC: a sample point for a 2-level section
	    cell over a 1-level sector
	  <li>Rend_Sample_BR: a sample point for virtual cells at +/- infinity
	</ul>
	<p>
      <dt>Rend_Win
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Win.h">Rend_Win.h</a> and <a
	  href="../../extensions/rend/Rend_Win.cc">Rend_Win.cc</a>.  The model I'm using for 
	these plotting programs distinguishes between the "view
	window", which is a rectangle in the cartesian plane, and the
	"rend window", which is rectangle on the screen.  An object of 
	type Rend_Win represents a "rend window" and includes the
	corresoponding "view window" coordinates.
	<p>
      <dt>Mapper
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/Mapper.h">Mapper.h</a> and <a
	  href="../../extensions/rend/Mapper.cc">Mapper.cc</a>.  A Mapper object represents
	the mapping of points from the "view rectangle" to points from
	the "rend rectangle".
		<p>
      <dt>gcmemloc
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/gcmemloc.h">gcmemloc.h</a>.  This file is basically
	a hack that allows garbage collected saclib "Word"'s that are
	global, static local, inside arrays, or inside class
	definitions.  It's not efficient, but it works without
	modifying the saclib garbage collector.  The inefficiencey
	only shows up at deallocations, so if you leave the local
	variables as normal old Word objects, then there's not too
	much overhead.
		<p>
      <dt>Safe_Array
      <dd>Defined in <a href="../../extensions/rend/Safe_Array.h">Safe_Array.h</a>.  I wrote
	this before  
	I had access to a compiler with STL (and before I knew I could 
	download implementations).  It's just a bare-bones templated
	array class. It does bounds checking which was nice when I was 
	hacking.
