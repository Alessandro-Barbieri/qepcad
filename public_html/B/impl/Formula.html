    <h1><a href="../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - Formulas<hr></h1>

    The idea here is to come up with some format for formulas that
    will allow me to do all the manipulations I want.  Here is the
    definition of a formula in this format.<p>
    Let D be a CAD and P be its projection factor set:
    <ol>
      <li>(TRUE) and (FALSE) are both formulas.<p>
      <li>((i,j),op) is a formula, where 0 < i <= |P| and 0 < j <=
      |P_i|, and op is in {LTOP,EQOP,GTOP,GEOP,NEOP,LEOP}.<p>
      <li>(ANDOP,F_1,...,F_i) is a formula, where i > 1 and
      F_1,...,F_i are formulas. <p>
      <li>(OROP,F_1,...,F_i) is a formula, where i > 1 and F_1,...,F_i
      are formulas. <p>
      <li>((i,j),(op,k)) is a formula,where 0 < i <= |P| and 0 < j <
      |P_i|, and op
      is in {LTOP,EQOP,GTOP,GEOP,NEOP,LEOP} and k is a non-zero int.
    </ol>
    The list (i,j) will refer to a polynomial in the following way:
    The signiture vector for a given cell assumes an ordering on the
    polynomials of a given level in P.  So, (i,j) refers to the jth
    polynomial in the ordering of the elements of P_i.
    The interpretation of 5. is probably deserving of some
    explanation.  Let us give a name to the polynomial (i,j), call
    it  q(x_1, ...,x_i).
    Then ((i,j),(op,k)) is interpreted as 
    <dl>
      <dt>if k > 0
	<dd><b>x_i op "the kth root of
    q(x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, X)"</b>, where <b>X</b> is a purely symbolic
    variable.  This atomic formula is true if and only 
    if q(x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, X) has at least k roots, and x_i bears
    relation op to the kth of these, ordered smallest to largest.
      <dt>if 0 > k
      <dd>x_i op "the |k|th root of
    q(x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, X)"</b>, where <b>X</b> is a purely symbolic
    variable.  This atomic formula is true if and only 
    if q(x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, X) has at least |k| roots, and x_i bears
    relation op to the |k|th of these, ordered largest to smallest.
