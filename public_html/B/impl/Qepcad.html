      <dt><b>Installing QEPCAD</b>
      <dd>Assuming that you've downloaded the QEPCAD directory
	tree, the root of which is called <code>qesource</code>,
	You need to make sure that the following two environment
	variables are set, <code>saclib</code> and
	<code>qe</code>.
	The variable <code>saclib</code> should contain the
	complete path up to and including <code>saclib2.1</code>, 
	the root of the saclib directory tree.  The variable
	<code>qe</code> should contain the
	complete path up to and including <code>qesource</code>, 
	the root of the saclib directory tree.  On my machine, for
	example: 
<pre>
valiant[312] [~/]> setenv qe /home/wcbrown/research/qesource
valiant[313] [~/]> setenv saclib /home/wcbrown/research/saclib2.1
</pre>
	... is how I've got my <code>qe</code> and <code>saclib</code>
	environment variables set.   After you've set these, do the
	following: 
	<pre>
cd $qe
make
	</pre>
	... and QEPCAD will compile ... I hope.  Note that
	<code>gmake</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>g++</code> 
	are all required.
<p>
	  If the 2D CAD plotting features aren't working, it's because 
	  the display program <code>$qe/bin/ADJ2D_plot</code> hasn't
	  been ported.  Just make
	  <code>$qe/bin/ADJ2D_plot</code> a symbolic link to
	  <code>/usr/bin/wc</code>, and you'll be able to use the
	  plotting features to produce postscript (eps) plots of
	  CAD's, although nothing will show up on the screen.
	<p>
	  
      <dt><b>The Original QEPCAD</b>
    <p>
      <dd>
	<dl>
	  
	  <dt><b>User Documentation</b>
	  <dd>Ideally this would include a desription of how to use
	    QEPCAD.  No time right now.  I leave you with a few examples.
	    <ul>
	      <li><a href="demo1">Example 1</a>, "The generic
		quadratic"
	      <li><a href="demo2">Example 2</a>, "The x-axis ellipse"
	    </ul>
	     [Note: These examples use my solution formula
	    extensions. If your QEPCAD is truly "the original",
	    instead of using <code>sol T</code> to get a solution
	    formula, you'd simply type <code>go</code>.]<br>
	    It is worth keeping in mind that QEPCAD has online help.
	    Type "help" at any time after the input formula has been
	    entered, and a list of commands is given.  For a given
	    command, type "whatis" followed by the command name, and
	    you should get documentation for that command.
	    <p>   
	  <dt><b>Implementation Documentation</b>
	  <dd>Ideally this would include a description of QEPCAD's
	    implementation, and clues on how to get started on adding
	    and modifying the program.  No time right now. I leave you 
	    with this info:
	    <ul>
	      <li><a href="Interface.html">Interface documentation</a>
	      <li><a href="Cell.html">Cell documentation</a>
	      <li><a href="Samplepoint.html">Sample-Point documentation</a>
	      <li><a href="Polynomial.html">Polynomial documentation</a>
	      <li><a href="formula">Formula documentation</a>
	    </ul>
	</dl>
	
	<p>
	  
	  
	  <dt><b>Extension's to QEPCAD</b>
	<p>
	  <dd>Ideally this would give ... well, you know.  Anyway, the 
	    two main commands my extensions offer are
	    <code>solution-extension</code> and <code>d-2d-cad</code>.
	    The <code>whatis</code> documentation for them is given
	    <a href="excptswhatis">here</a>.

</pre>
	    <dl>
	      <dt><b>User Documentation</b>
	      <dd><dd>Here are the primary commands comprising my
		QEPCAD extensions:
		<p>
		<dl>
		  <dt><code>solution-extension x</code>
		    <dd>	
		    Use an alternative solution formula construction method.  The
		    parameter x is allowed to be T,E,G, or I.  If x is T, then a
		    formula in the usual language of Tarski formulas is produced.
		    If x is E, a formula in the language of Extended Tarski formulas
		    is produced.  If x is G, then a geometry-based formul is
		    produced. Finally, if x is I, and "interactive mode" is entered
		    and the user is queried to determine how the formula is to be
		    constructed and displayed.
<p>
		  <dt><code>simple-cad-info N</code>
		  <dd>
		    Simple CAD information.  If N is zero, the usual CAD
		    simplification is performed.  If it is 1, simplification
		    is done solely by considering full dimensional cells.
		    This option simply displays stats.
<p>
		  <dt><code>replace-with-simple (0,0)</code>
		  <dd>This command replaces QEPCAD's CAD with a
		    simplified CAD.  This messes with the program a
		    fair bit, so other than printing out a projection
		    factor list, or plotting with
		    <code>d-2d-cad</code>, I wouldn't trust any
		    subsequent commands.  This is here mostly because
		    I'm often interested in plotting a simplified
		    CAD.  The command <code>solution-extension
		      E</code> will also work after using 
		    <code>replace-with-simple (0,0)</code>.
<p>
		  <dt><code>d-2d-cad [ D ] | [ E x1 x2 y1 y2 Sx Sy e ]</code>
		  <dd>This command displays a 2D CAD.  Ideally,
		    display will be on the screen, but even if that
		    doesn't work (it requires a second program called
		    ADJ2D_plot) this command can still be used to
		    produce plots in postscript (eps) file format.
		    Typcially <code>d-2d-cad D</code> is the command
		    you'd want, and what happens next is fairly self
		    explanatory.
