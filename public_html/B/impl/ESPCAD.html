    The ESPCAD (or Extended-Sign PCAD) just extends the PCAD
    structure. The pieces of information to be added are 
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>SC_SIGN</b>
      <dd>
      If cell C is an i-level cell of an ESPCAD (Extended sub-CAD), then
      field SC_SIGN is a list (s_1,s_2, ... ,s_m), such that there are
      m i-level projection factors for the ESPCAD, and s_j is the sign of
      the jth i-level projection factor in C.
      <p>
      <dt><b>SC_EXTS</b>
      <dd>
      If cell C is an i-level cell of an ESPCAD (Extended sub-CAD), then
      field SC_EXTS is a list (s_1,s_2, ... ,s_m), such that there are
      m i-level projection factors for the ESPCAD, and s_j is the
      <a href="Polyindex.html"><b>index</b></a>
      of the jth i-level projection factor in C.
      <p>
      <dt><b>SC_TMPM</b>
      <dd>This is a temporary mark whose use is variable.
      <p>
      <dt><b>SC_RRNV</b>
      <dd>If cell C is an i-level cell of an ESPCAD (Extended sub-CAD), then
      field SC_RRNV is a list (s_1,s_2, ... ,s_m), such that there are
      m (i+1)-level projection factors, and s_j gives the number of
      distinct real roots of the jth (m+1)-level projection factor
      over C.  If the jth polynomial is identically zero over C, then
      s_j is -1.
