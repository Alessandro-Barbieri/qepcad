    <h1><a href="../QEPCAD.html">Q E P C A D</a> - QEPCAD Interface Documentation<hr/></h1>
    The user interface to QEPCAD is implemented through the files
    $qe/source/qepcad.help and $qe/source/userint/USERINT.c.

<p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>qepcad.help</b>
      <dd>
	Each command has an entree in qepcad.help that looks something
	like:
	<pre>
d-all-cells-in-subtree 48 de d
@
d-all-cells-in-subtree C 

Displays the info about all the cells in the subtree
rooted at the cell with index C.
@
	</pre>
	The first line contains the command's name (d-all-cells-in-subtree 
	in this case), a unique identifying number for the command (48 in
	this case), a string that is a substring of "abcde" (de in this
	case) which defines the phases of the program in which the command 
	is available, and a string that is one of 
	pc, d, proj, a, m, cp (d in this case) indicating the type ofthe
	command. The command types are defined at the end of qepcad.help
	<pre>
pc @Program control:@
d @Displaying information:@
proj @Modifying the projection set:@
a @Selecting algorithms:@
m @Miscellaneous:@
cp @Chris's Play:@
	</pre>
	What appears between the @'s is just documentation that's
	available to the QEPCAD user via the whatis command.
<p>
      <dt><b>USERINT.c</b>
      <dd>QEPCAD gets input from the user by calling the function
	USERINT defined in USERINT.c.  This function calls GETCID
	which reads in a command from the user, matches it with a
	command definition in qepcad.help, and returns the unique id
	number for that command.  The remainder of USERINT is a big
	switch statement that switches on that id and performs the
	associated action.
    </dl>
    <p>
      Adding a command to QEPCAD thus consists of adding the
      appropriate entry to qepcad.help, and adding a line for the 
      new index to the switch statement in USERINT.c.
