    <h2>Overview</h2>
    The "Naive Solution Formula Construction" (NSFCONST) method is my
    first attempt to write a simple, fast method for constructing
    simple solution formulas.  It assumes a projection definable CAD
    <b>D</b> with projection factor set <b>P</b>, as well as a subset
    <b>S</b> of <b>P</b> (possibly <b>S = P</b>) such that the
    elements in <b>S</b> suffice for solution formula construction.
    It proceeds to construct a solution formula in three steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Construct <b>L_t</b> a list of the true cells in <b>D</b>,
      and <b>L_f</b> a list of the false cells in <b>D</b>.
      <li>Using <b>L_t</b> and <b>L_f</b> construct a list <b>L</b>
      of prime  implicants, such that every cell in <b>L_t</b> is
      captured by at least one implicant in <b>L</b> --- i.e. <b>L</b>
      <em>covers</em> <b>L_t</b>.
      <li>Construct <b>SF</b>, a minimum cardinality subset of
      <b>L</b> that still covers <b>L_t</b>.
    </ol>
    Clearly, the disjunction of the implicants in <b>SF</b> is a
    solution formula.
    <h2>Implementation Overview --- The heuristic</h2>
    The main implementation issue here is the construction of <b>L</b>
    in Step 2.  This is done iteratively, starting with <b>L</b> as
    the empty list and successively adding implicants to it until it
    covers <b>L_t</b>.  At each iteration, a cell in <b>L_t</b> is
    chosen that is not already covered by <b>L</b>.  A minimum
    lengthed prime implicant covering the cell is then constructed and
    added to <b>L</b>.  The heuricstic here is that short implicants
    tend to cover more cells than long implicants.  So by focusing on
    short implicants we hope to cover all the true cells with few
    implicants.

    <h3>Choosing cells</h3>
    The order in which cells from <b>L_t</b> are chosen in Step 2 can
    have considerable effect on NSFCONST's performance; both in the
    time required to construct a formula and in the simplicity of the
    result.  A rough heuristic argument and some experimental evidence
    led me to decide upon choosing cells by a largest dimension first
    policy.  How is this accomplished?  Between Step 1 and Step 2, the
    elements of <b>L_t</b> are sorted by dimension.  After a new
    implicant is added to <b>L</b>, all elements of <b>L_t</b> that
    are covered by the implicant are deleted.  The order of the
    elements that remain is, however, unaltered.  Thus, the first
    element of <b>L_t</b> is always a true cell of largest dimension
    among those not covered by <b>L</b>.

    <h3>Constructing Shortest Prime Implicants</h3>
    The shortest implicant problem is translated into a minimum
    hitting set problem.  The underlying set <b>Q</b> is the set of
    all atomic formulas on the elements of <b>S</b> that the chosen
    true cell satisfies.  For each false cell <b>c</b> in <b>L_f</b>
    we construct the set <b>T_c</b> of elements of <b>Q</b> that
    <b>c</b> does not satisfy.  If <b>H</b> is a hitting set for the
    collection of all <b>T_c</b>'s, then the conjunction of the
    elements of <b>H</b> is a minimum lengthed implicant covering the
    chosen true cell.

    <h3>Constructing <b>SF</b> from <b>L</b></h3>
    <b>SF</b> is also constructed using a minimum cardinality hitting
    set algorithm.  <b>L</b> is the underlying set, and for each true
    cell <b>c</b> we construct a subset <b>T_c</b> of <b>L</b>
    consisting of all implicants in <b>L</b> that capture <b>c</b>.
    <b>SF</b> is constructed as a minimum cardinaltiy hitting set for
    the collection of all <b>T_c</b>'s.

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    Before listing functions specific to NSFCONST, I should point out
    that this implementation operates on a pruned-CAD data structure.
