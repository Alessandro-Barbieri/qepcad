<h1><b>THIS IS ALL PRETTY OUT OF DATE!!</b></h1>

I'm trying to build an adjacency algorithm for 2D CAD's which will
work quickly and be easy to implement.  I won't guarantee a solution,
but I will guarantee that any solution given is correct.  When
adjacencies cannot be decided, the algorithm will enumerate the
possible adjacencies so that a future extension could use other
methods to make these decisions.

<UL>
<LI><B>Specifications</B><br>
I determine adjacencies for amongst cells in 3 successive stacks
simultaeneously; the second of the three having a section as a base.
The main function of the method solves this problem.
<BLOCKQUOTE>L <- <A HREF="ADJ_2D.c">ADJ_2D(c,c_l,c_r,P,J)</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
c is a section cell in the 1D CAD, c_l is the sector to the left of c,
and c_r the section to the right.  P is the projection factor set, and
J the projection polynomial set.  The return value L will be a list
of elements of the form ((i,j),(k,l)) indicating an adjacency between
cell (i,j) and cell (k,l).  More exact information is given below.

<LI>The Adj2D_Cell datatype<br>
The intent is that the adjacency calculations be
based purely on multiplicity information and cell indices.  Thus, a
cell in the 2D CAD will be represented as a list: (I,M), where I is
the cell index, and M is the multiplicity vector; i.e. a list of 
length = |P_2|, where P_2 is the set of level 2 projection factors,
such that the ith element of M is the multiplicity of the ith element
of P_2 in the cell.  I refer to this as the Adj2D_Cell datatype.
</LI>
<LI>Adjacency datatype<br>
A single adjacency A is a list (I,J), where I and J are pairs of
BETA-digits, so A = ( (i1,i2) , (j1,j2) ), i1,i2,j1,j2 BETA-digits.
I and J are cell indices ... usually. The one exception has to do with
asymptotes.  In each stack over a section cell k of the 1-dimensional
CAD, we've added the cells (k,AD2D_Infy) and (k,AD2D_N_In), where
AD2D_Infy and AD2D_N_In are constants defined in adj2D.h.  If a
section is adjacent to (k,AD2D_Infy), then it has a vertical asymptote
over k where it approaches positive infinity. If a
section is adjacent to (k,AD2D_N_In), then it has a vertical asymptote
over k where it approaches negative infinity. Note:  At present, 
i1 + 1 = j1 holds for every adjacency the algorithm produces.

<LI><B>How It Works</b><br>
Suppose we start with c_{i-1}, c_i, and c_{i+1} - where c_i is a
section cell.  Basically I just try to enumerate all possible
"solutions" to this adjacency problem, where a "solution" is a list of
all adjacencies between sections over c_i and sections over c_{i-1},
and between sections over c_i and sections over c_{i+1}.  I have rules
about these solutions though, and I throw out all "solutions" which
violate these rules.  If a unique "solution" is left, then I know I
have THE solution.  Otherwise, I have to find another method for
deciding which of the many solutions is THE solution.<p>
Naturally, I try to be clever, and I don't generate all possible
solutions and then weed out the bad ones.  I generate only those
solutions which don't violate my rules.

<h2>The real world -- Partial CAD's and Infallible adjacency</h2>
There are two problems that my adjacency method can encounter:  in a
partial CAD we might not have constructed all of the three adjacent
stacks we need for my adjacency method, and in some situations this
method fails to provide a unique adjacency assignment, and a decision
muct somehow be made between the several alternatives it returns.
<p>
In the case of a "missing" stack, i.e. a stack which has not been
constructed but which is needed by my adjacency method, I take the
easy way out:  I simply construct the stack.  The missing stack will
always be a stack over an open interval, so the time required for
constructing that stack should b pretty small.  Another alternative
would be a modified algorithm which deals with two adjacent stacks and
not three.   The function which determines adjacencies in any
situation is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>L <- <A
HREF="ADJ_2D_PART.c">ADJ_2D(_PARTc,c_l,c_r,P,J)</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
It calls:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="ADJ_2D_CONSTRUCT.c">ADJ_2D_CONSTRUCT(c,P2)</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
to construct missing stacks.  To decide between multiple possible
adjacency assignments it uses:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="infallible/ADJ_2D_DECIDE.c">ADJ_2D_DECIDE(Sol,c,c_l,c_r,P,J)</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
