      <dt><b>What's the latest?</b></dt>
      <dd>
	The current version of SLFQ is 1.18.  This version should
	compile without trouble on 32 or 64 bit linux and MacOS boxes.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>What is SLFQ?</b></dt>
      <dd>
	SLFQ is a program for simplifying very large quantifier-free
	formulas.  It is a command-line program with a small degree of
	user interaction.  SLFQ simplifies formulas by repeated calls
	to <a href="../B/QEPCAD.html">QEPCAD B</a>,
	essentially using QEPCAD B as a "black box" for simplification
	in a naive divide-and-conquer approach.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>How do I use SLFQ?</b></dt>
      <dd>
	More documentation should appear at this site soon.  For the
	moment, please consult the documentation in the README file
	contained in the SLFQ installation, or take a look at
	<a href="Ex1/Example1.html">this example</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>How do I get/install SLFQ?</b></dt>
      <dd>
	SLFQ itself is a tiny program, most of its work being really
	done by QEPCAD B.  So, if you can get QEPCAD B installed, SLFQ
	should be no problem.  This means that under Solaris and Linux
	and MacOS
	things should be OK.
	<ol>
	  <li>Download and install QEPCAD B version 1.61 or higher.
	    (<a href="../INSTALL/IQ.html"><small>Instructions &amp; Download</a></small>)
	  </li>
	  <li>Download SLFQ: <a href="simplify-1.18.tar.gz">simplify-1.18.tar.gz</a></li>
	  <li>Unzip and untar simplify-1.18.tar.gz.</li>
	  <li>Change to the <code>simplify</code> directory and type "<code>make</code>".</li>
	  <li>Hopefully the executable <code>./slfq</code> is sitting
	    in your <code>simplify</code> directory waiting to be used!</li>
	</ol>
	The <code>README</code> file contains directions on using and installing
	SLFQ.  There is a directory called <code>examples</code>
	which, appropriately enough, contains some examples
	illustrating the use of the program.
